Live 12 MIDI Tool generator for Euclidean rhythms. 

Uses whole clip length or selection length split according to Steps. (does not care about time signature etc)

Accents and Accent-Offset apply to Beats, same way as Beats and Offset apply to Steps.

Note length is simply a percent of Step size.

Can acquire pad/note names from a DrumRack found downstream of current clip.
