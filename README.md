Live 12 MIDI Tool generator for Euclidean rhythms. 

Uses whole clip length or selection length split according to Steps. (does not care about time signature etc)

Accents and Accent-Offset apply to Beats, same way as Beats and Offset apply to Steps.

Note length is simply a percent of Step size.

Can acquire pad/note names from a DrumRack found downstream of current clip.

Example Usage:

1. Create track with a DrumRack, maybe "808 Core Kit"
2. Create 4 bar clip and select klfEuclideanGen from Generators menu.
3. Pull up floating window by clicking bottom-right button of embedded UI.
4. Click "GET NOTENAMES FROM DRUMRACK".
5. Assign notes e.g. 0 Bass Drum, 1 Closed HiHat, 2 Open HiHat, 3 Snare Drum, 4 Rimshot, 5 Maracas, 6 Low Conga, 7 Mid Conga, 8 Hi Conga.
6. Click on [64] in the "SET MAX RANGE" selector.
7. Click the big "INDIVIDUAL LOCK BUTTONS ACTIVE" button at bottom.
8. Click the little lock on Channel 0 (Bass Drum) STEPS then drag number and set it to 8. (NOT the Channel Lock!)
9. Click the little lock on Channel 0 (Bass Drum) BEATS then drag number and set it to 8.
10. Click the little lock on Channel 1 (Closed HiHat) STEPS then drag number and set it to 64.
11.  Click the little lock on Channel 2 (Open HiHat) STEPS then drag number and set it to 64.
